### ABOUT:<br/>
The aim of the Data Walking research project is to collect environmental data while walking around North Greenwich, to build a rich picture of that area over time. There will be one walk per month for the first six months of 2016 and open to anyone who wants to join and explore the area, ideas on data gathering techniques, and the field of data visualisation.

Before each walk there will be a session to help make different data gathering devices including sensors on micro controllers, smart phones, and hand recorded notes.

The data gathered on each walk will then be used to create maps, charts, data experiences, or artistic works by participants to represent the area and the process of the project. Data will be shared and made publicly available.

Ongoing work will feature on this website, and the facebook group, please join [here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1044556812269511/)

At the end of the project submitted work will be compiled into a printed publication and be part of a public exhibition!

Data Walking is a research project by [David Hunter](http://davidhunterdesign.com), funded by the [Ravensbourne Research Office](https://www.ravensbourne.ac.uk/research/).

### DATA:
All the data and photographs are gathered and shared freely here on github.

Please use the data to create visualisations, maps, artistic responses, and even tools in the creation of more creative outcomes using data. Let us know what you come up with and we can try to include it in the project publication!
