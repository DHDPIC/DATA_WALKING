# OTHER WALKS
I have added a bunch of other walks that have been done, some are early tests, others from  early workshops, and from different corners of the world when I travelled for work or leisure.

Some are poorly labelled with no header in the csv file to indicate what data in that column means. I have or will try to add this to a best guess. Some file names let you know what the data is.

I haven't included purely photographic walks as it is too much to upload hundreds of photos to GitHub.
