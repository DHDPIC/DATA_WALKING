# PUBLICATION EXAMPLES
Here you will find example code and resources from the publication. There are a great number of other bits of code for [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Processing](https://www.processing.org/) included under the TOOLS section. Other code on Data Walking repo will probably be revised, edited, and added to over time, but this set should remain unchanged (or unchanged as far as possible) to tally with the publication.

Code is divided into input and output folders. Input and output code are for Arduino or Processing; check which with the file extension: .ino is for Arduino, and .pde is for Processing. There are a number of different input and output folders in each example workflow. The exports from  input code can be used by certain output code. This is reflected in the naming structure so the export of input_1 can be used by output_1_1 as well as output_1_2, but input_2 should be used with output_2_1, output_2_2 etc. It is quite logical and simple really once you are using it, and allows some flexibility without too much repetition, while gently stepping through different code examples with small but important differences.

### INPUT
This code is generally for Arduino, but also uses Processing. There are circuit diagrams where necessary so you can build the circuits, and parts lists. The examples make heavy use of the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Shield and associated libraries. Make sure you have downloaded and installed those properly. There may be some tidying/wrangling of data in order to get the exported data from the code into the best condition for reuse. Please check the readme for any of these extra steps.

### OUTPUT
This code is generally for Processing. It makes heavy use of the [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/) library, by Til Nagel. As of running and writing this project resource it only runs on Processing version 2. Make sure you have downloaded the correct version of Processing, and you have installed the [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/) library, which you can get via the menu bar Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library... and search for Unfolding Maps. There may be some additional steps or pieces of software needed in order to get the exported outcome from the code ready for final outputting on a particular machine or format. Please check the readme for any of these extra steps. There is example export files from the code, but also example imagery of the outcome or variations of the outcome existing in the real world.
